### **🔧 UPDATED FILES:**

#### **📍 Routes (`routes/web.php`):**
```php

Route::middleware(['auth', 'teacher'])->prefix('teacher')->name('teacher.')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', [DashboardController::class, 'index'])->name('dashboard');
    Route::get('/profile', [DashboardController::class, 'profile'])->name('profile');
    
    // Mark entry routes
    Route::prefix('marks')->name('marks.')->group(function () {
        Route::get('/', [MarkController::class, 'index'])->name('index');
        Route::get('/exam/{exam}/create', [MarkController::class, 'create'])->name('create');
        Route::post('/exam/{exam}/store', [MarkController::class, 'store'])->name('store');
        Route::post('/exam/{exam}/submit', [MarkController::class, 'submit'])->name('submit');
        Route::get('/results', [MarkController::class, 'results'])->name('results');
    });
});

// Admin teacher-subject assignment routes
Route::resource('teacher-subjects', TeacherSubjectController::class);
```

#### **⚙️ Middleware Registration (`bootstrap/app.php`):**
```php
$middleware->alias([
    'teacher' => \App\Http\Middleware\TeacherMiddleware::class,
]);

$assignment = TeacherSubject::where('user_id', $teacher->id)
    ->where('subject_id', $exam->subject_id)
    ->where('class_id', $exam->class_id)
    ->where('is_active', true)
