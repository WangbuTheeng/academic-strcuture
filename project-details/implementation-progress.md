## 🎯 **NEXT IMMEDIATE TASKS**

### Priority 1: Complete Database Migrations
1. **Finish core structure migrations** (classes, programs)
2. **Implement academic management migrations** (academic_years, semesters, subjects)
3. **Create student management migrations** (students, enrollments)
4. **Set up examination system migrations** (exams, marks)

### Priority 2: Create Eloquent Models
1. **Core models** with relationships
2. **Model factories** for testing
3. **Database seeders** with sample data

### Priority 3: Authentication Setup
1. **Configure Laravel Fortify**

---

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DECISIONS MADE**

### Frontend Approach
- **Traditional Laravel + Blade** instead of Livewire/Alpine.js heavy approach
- **Minimal Alpine.js** only for essential interactions (dropdowns)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for form validation and calculations
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling

### Database Approach
- **MySQL 8.0** as primary database
- **Foreign key constraints** for data integrity
- **Soft deletes** only on students table
- **Audit logging** for critical operations

### Package Decisions
- **Spatie Laravel Permission** for role-based access control
- **Spatie Laravel Activity Log** for audit trails
- **Spatie Laravel Backup** for data backup
- **barryvdh/laravel-dompdf** for PDF generation
- **Alpine.js** for minimal JavaScript interactions

## ⚠️ **ISSUES ENCOUNTERED**

### 1. Nepali Date Package
- **Issue:** `nepalidate/laravel` package not available
- **Status:** Deferred - will implement custom Nepali date functionality later
- **Impact:** Low - can be implemented as utility class

### 2. Windows Command Line
- **Issue:** PowerShell doesn't support `&&` operator for chaining commands
- **Solution:** Created batch file for migration creation
- **Status:** Resolved
