# 🏗️ Super Admin Architecture & Data Isolation PDR
**Project Design Requirements - Multi-Tenant Data Architecture**

## 📋 Overview

This PDR defines the architectural foundation for the Super Admin system, focusing on multi-tenant data isolation, security patterns, and scalable design principles that ensure complete data sovereignty for each school while maintaining system-wide governance capabilities.

---

## 🎯 Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Multi-Tenant Data Isolation
- **Primary Key**: Every school assigned unique `school_id`
- **Data Scoping**: All school-specific data linked via `school_id` foreign key
- **Query Filtering**: Automatic injection of `school_id` in all database operations
- **Session Context**: School identity maintained throughout user session

### 2. Composite Uniqueness Constraints
```sql
-- Example: Faculty names unique per school, not globally
UNIQUE KEY unique_faculty_per_school (name, school_id)

-- Example: Class names unique per school
UNIQUE KEY unique_class_per_school (name, level_id, school_id)

-- Example: Student roll numbers unique per class and school
UNIQUE KEY unique_roll_per_class_school (roll_number, class_id, school_id)
```

### 3. Data Sovereignty Model
- **School Autonomy**: Each school manages its own nomenclature independently
- **No Cross-School Conflicts**: Identical names allowed across different schools
- **Isolated Operations**: All CRUD operations scoped to school context

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Requirements

#### Core Tables Structure
```sql
-- Schools table (managed by Super Admin)
CREATE TABLE schools (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    code VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    address TEXT,
    status ENUM('active', 'inactive', 'suspended') DEFAULT 'active',
    settings JSON,
    created_by BIGINT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Example school-specific table
CREATE TABLE faculties (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    school_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (school_id) REFERENCES schools(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE KEY unique_faculty_per_school (name, school_id)
);
```

#### Mandatory Schema Patterns
1. **Every school-specific table MUST include `school_id`**
2. **Foreign key constraints to `schools.id`**
3. **Composite unique constraints with `school_id`**
4. **Cascade delete for data cleanup**

### Query Filtering Middleware

#### Automatic School Context Injection
```php
// Middleware example
class SchoolContextMiddleware
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        if (auth()->check() && session('school_context')) {
            // Inject school_id into all Eloquent queries
            Model::addGlobalScope('school', function ($builder) {
                $builder->where('school_id', session('school_context'));
            });
        }
        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

#### Model Implementation Pattern
```php
// Base model for school-specific entities
abstract class SchoolScopedModel extends Model
{
    protected static function boot()
    {
        parent::boot();
        
        // Auto-assign school_id on creation
        static::creating(function ($model) {
            if (session('school_context')) {
                $model->school_id = session('school_context');
            }
        });
        
        // Auto-scope all queries
        static::addGlobalScope('school', function ($builder) {
            if (session('school_context')) {
                $builder->where('school_id', session('school_context'));
            }
        });
    }
}
```

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

### Authentication Flow
1. **School Login**: School ID + Password → Validate → Set session context
2. **Session Management**: Maintain `school_id` throughout session
3. **Query Scoping**: All operations filtered by session `school_id`
4. **Logout**: Clear session context and school-specific data

### Access Control Matrix
| Role | School Data Access | Cross-School Access | System Management |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Super Admin | ❌ None | ❌ None | ✅ Full |
| School Admin | ✅ Own School Only | ❌ None | ❌ None |
| School Staff | ✅ Own School Only | ❌ None | ❌ None |

### Data Protection Measures
- **Encrypted Passwords**: bcrypt hashing for all credentials
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communications encrypted
- **Session Security**: Timeout, regeneration, secure cookies
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute-force attacks
- **Audit Logging**: All Super Admin actions logged

---

## 📊 Scalability Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- **Database Indexing**: Composite indexes on `(school_id, other_columns)`
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient filtering at database level
- **Caching Strategy**: School-specific cache keys
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connections

### Growth Planning
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Support for multiple database instances
- **Sharding Strategy**: Potential school-based data sharding
- **CDN Integration**: Static asset distribution
- **Load Balancing**: Multi-server deployment support

---

## 🔍 Validation & Testing Requirements

### Data Isolation Tests
```php
// Test: Two schools can create identical entities
public function test_schools_can_have_identical_faculty_names()
{
    $schoolA = School::factory()->create(['code' => 'SCHOOL_A']);
    $schoolB = School::factory()->create(['code' => 'SCHOOL_B']);
    
    // Both schools create "Science" faculty
    $facultyA = Faculty::create([
        'school_id' => $schoolA->id,
        'name' => 'Science Department'
    ]);
    
    $facultyB = Faculty::create([
        'school_id' => $schoolB->id,
        'name' => 'Science Department'
    ]);
    
    $this->assertNotEquals($facultyA->id, $facultyB->id);
    $this->assertEquals('Science Department', $facultyA->name);
    $this->assertEquals('Science Department', $facultyB->name);
}
```

### Security Tests
- **Cross-school data access prevention**
- **Session hijacking protection**
- **SQL injection prevention**
- **Authorization bypass attempts**
