# Super-Admin Multi-School System Implementation Plan

## 📋 Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation plan for transforming the current single-tenant Academic Management System into a multi-school system managed by a Super-admin.

### 🎯 Objectives
- **Super-admin** can create and manage multiple schools
- Each school gets unique **School ID and Password**
- **Complete data isolation** between schools
- **Same features** but **separate data** for each school
- **Scalable architecture** for unlimited schools

### 🏗️ Architecture Approach
**Selected: Single Database with school_id Foreign Key**
- ✅ Complete data isolation through school_id scoping
- ✅ Easier maintenance and deployment
- ✅ Better performance than multi-database
- ✅ Laravel ORM native support
- ✅ Future-proof for cross-school analytics

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema Changes

### 📊 New Tables

#### 1. `schools` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE schools (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    code VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,  -- School identifier (ABC001, PQR002)
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,    -- Hashed school password
    email VARCHAR(255),
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    address TEXT,
    logo_path VARCHAR(255),
    status ENUM('active', 'inactive', 'suspended') DEFAULT 'active',
    settings JSON,                     -- School-specific configurations
    created_by BIGINT,                 -- Super-admin who created
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    
    INDEX idx_code (code),
    INDEX idx_status (status),
    FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

### 🔄 Modified Tables (Add school_id)

#### Core Tables to Modify:
```sql
-- Add school_id to all major tables
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN school_id BIGINT AFTER id;
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN school_id BIGINT AFTER id;
ALTER TABLE student_enrollments ADD COLUMN school_id BIGINT AFTER id;
ALTER TABLE levels ADD COLUMN school_id BIGINT AFTER id;
ALTER TABLE faculties ADD COLUMN school_id BIGINT AFTER id;
ALTER TABLE departments ADD COLUMN school_id BIGINT AFTER id;
ALTER TABLE classes ADD COLUMN school_id BIGINT AFTER id;
ALTER TABLE programs ADD COLUMN school_id BIGINT AFTER id;
ALTER TABLE subjects ADD COLUMN school_id BIGINT AFTER id;
ALTER TABLE exams ADD COLUMN school_id BIGINT AFTER id;
ALTER TABLE marks ADD COLUMN school_id BIGINT AFTER id;
ALTER TABLE institute_settings ADD COLUMN school_id BIGINT AFTER id;

-- Add foreign key constraints
ALTER TABLE users ADD FOREIGN KEY (school_id) REFERENCES schools(id);
-- (Repeat for all tables)

-- Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_users_school_id ON users(school_id);
-- (Repeat for all tables)
```

## 👥 User Role System

### 🔐 New Role Hierarchy
```
super-admin (Global Level)
├── admin (School Level)
├── principal (School Level)
├── teacher (School Level)
└── student (School Level)
```

### 📋 Role Permissions

#### Super-Admin Permissions
- ✅ Create/Edit/Delete schools
- ✅ Manage school credentials
- ✅ View all schools data (read-only)
- ✅ System-wide settings and maintenance
- ✅ Global analytics and reports
- ❌ Cannot modify school-specific data directly

#### School-Level Roles (Existing + school_id scope)
- **Admin**: Full school management within their school
- **Principal**: School operations within their school  
- **Teacher**: Teaching duties within their school
- **Student**: Learning activities within their school

## 🔐 Authentication System

### 🚪 Login Flow

#### 1. Super-Admin Login
```
URL: /super-admin/login
Fields: Email + Password
Access: Global system management
```

#### 2. School-Specific Login  
```
URL: /login
Fields: School Code + Email + Password
Process:
1. Validate school code exists and is active
2. Authenticate user within that school context
3. Set school context for session
4. Redirect to role-based dashboard
```

### 🛡️ Security Implementation

#### School Context Middleware
```php
class SchoolContextMiddleware
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        // Ensure user belongs to accessed school
        // Set school context in session
        // Prevent cross-school data access
    }
}
```

#### Global Scopes for Data Isolation
```php
// Auto-filter all queries by school_id
class SchoolScope implements Scope
{
    public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model)
    {
        if (auth()->check() && !auth()->user()->hasRole('super-admin')) {
            $builder->where('school_id', auth()->user()->school_id);
        }
    }
}
```

## 📱 User Interface Changes

### 🎛️ Super-Admin Dashboard
- **School Management**: Create, edit, view schools
- **School Monitoring**: Active users, system health per school
- **Global Analytics**: Cross-school statistics
- **System Settings**: Global configurations

### 🏫 School-Specific Interfaces
- **School Branding**: Logo, colors, name display
- **Context Indicator**: Always show current school
- **Isolated Data**: Only show school's data
- **Same Features**: All existing functionality preserved

## 📊 Example School Setup

### School Creation Process
1. **Super-admin** creates new school:
   - Name: "ABC International School"
   - Code: "ABC001" 
   - Password: "abc_secure_2024"

2. **System** automatically:
   - Creates school record
   - Generates default academic structure
   - Creates school admin account
   - Sets up default settings

3. **Super-admin** provides credentials to school:
   - School Code: ABC001
   - Admin Email: admin@abc001.school
   - Admin Password: (generated)

4. **School users** login with:
   - School Code: ABC001
   - Email: their_email@abc001.school
   - Password: their_password

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Performance Considerations
- **Database Indexing**: school_id indexes on all tables
- **Query Optimization**: Automatic school_id filtering
- **Caching Strategy**: School-specific cache keys
- **Session Management**: School context in sessions

### Data Migration Strategy
- **Existing Data**: Migrate to default school
- **Zero Downtime**: Gradual migration approach
- **Rollback Plan**: Complete rollback capability
- **Testing**: Comprehensive migration testing

### Security Measures
- **Data Isolation**: Global scopes + middleware
- **Access Control**: Role-based + school-based
